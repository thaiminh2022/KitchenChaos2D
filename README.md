# KitchenChaos2D

A port of the famous [**CodeMonkey**][CodeMonkey] 10 hours Unity tutorial: KitchenChaos to 2D using [**GodotEngine**][godot_engine] & [**Aseprite**][aseprite_url] to make assets.

## ‚ú® How To Pronounce My Name

My birth name is Thai, which is a Vietnamese name. I got my nick name Thaiminh2022 when I was 3 years of age playing games with a brother named Minh.

- Thai: **tie** with a **stress**.
- Minh: the word **min**

## üì∞ About

- In January, [**CodeMonkey**][CodeMonkey] released one of his most comprehensive tutorial for game development for **free**.
- However, this tutorial use [**Unity**][unity_engine] as the game engine.
- This is my attempt to port the game to the godot engine in **2D**

> üìù Notes </br>
> I create this repo to document changes I had to make to the source code for it to work with the Godot engine in case anyone have the same problem. </br>
>**If you want to know what are the changes, please prefer to the next next section**.

## üî∞ Get Started

- This repo reflects my journey of learning how to do game development using the **godot engine**.
- You are **free to use the repo as a starting point**

```bash
# HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/thaiminh2022/KitchenChaos2D.git

# github cli
gh repo clone thaiminh2022/KitchenChaos2D
```

> **! WARNING** </br>
> Some practices used in the original [**CodeMonkey**][CodeMonkey] tutorial video have to be changed because of dimension and engine differences. </br>
> **If you want to know what are the changes, please prefer to the next section**.

## üíª Code Changes

***If you think you have better ideas for these listed problem, see contributing.***

### Singleton vs Autoload

In short, if you want to use singleton for only a scene, use normal C# singleton. If you want your singleton to persist after scene change, use autoload.

#### C# Singleton

```cs
public class ClassName {
  public static ClassName Instance {get; private set;} 

  // Enter tree get calls when this node enter scene tree, or change it's parents.
  public override void _EnterTree() {
    Instance = this;
  }
}
```

If you are using this method, you **HAVE TO** reset the singleton everytime you re-enter your scene, since godot does not do that automatically for you.
One method is to have a reseter that automatically reset everytime before you enter the scene that contains the singleton.

```cs
public class ClassName {
  public static ClassName Instance {get; private set;} 
  
  public static void ResetStatic() {
    Instance = null
  }
  // Enter tree get calls when this node enter scene tree, or change it's parents.
  public override void _EnterTree() {
    Instance = this;
  }
}

public class AnotherClassInAnotherScene {
  public override void _Ready() {
    ClassName.Instance.ResetStatic();
  }
}
```

#### Autoload

Autoload in godot is better explained using the [docs][autoload_docs]

### GetComponent() vs GetNode()

These are Unity and Godot way to basicly get the attached script of a game object, repsectively. However, there are clear differences in syntax and the way both engine work.

```cs
using UnityEngine; // GetComponent exists in UnityEngine
using Godot; // GetNode exists in Godot

// Unity
T component = GetComponent<T>();

// Godot
T node = GetNode<T>(pathToNode);
```

#### GetComponent

- Get the component attach to the current gameobject.
- If there are multiples component with the same type, it will get the first component.

> - **GetComponent returns null if there're no component, no error is thrown**
> - **GetComponent can get interface  that given to the component**

#### GetNode

- Get the children node of the node where the function is called.
- You have to specify the path, multiple component will results in the first instance.

> - **GetNode returns null if there're no component in the specified path, no error is thrown**
> - **GetNode cannot get interface  that given to the component**

**Solution** </br>
Use pattern matching instead

```cs
interface IInterface {
    // A interface
}

if (component is IInterface _interface) {
    // Do something with _interface
}
```

### EventHandler vs [Signal]

- EventHandler is a standard c# delegate use for **event**, see **Observer pattern**.
- Signal is an attribute, which is also Godot own take on **event**, use EventHandler under the hood with some differences.

```csharp
using System; // EventHandler exists in System
using Godot; // Signal exists in System  

private event EventHandler<EventArgs> OnEventHappend;

// Signal must end with EventHandler
[Signal] private delegate void EventHappenedEventHandler();
```

|                               |       EventHandler       |                   Signal                    |
| ----------------------------- | :----------------------: | :-----------------------------------------: |
| Interaction with Godot Engine |      No interaction      |          Showed in the signal tab           |
| Interaction with other nodes  |     Only in C# files     | Interact with anything using the signal tab |
| Usage in interface            | Can be use in interfaces |        Cannot be used in interfaces         |

I originally use signal as it was more conventional for Godot, however CodeMonkey later use EventHandler in an interface, which sinal can't so I switched back to EventHandler. </br>

>**Warning** </br>
> If you are using a static event, you **HAVE TO** unsubcribe before the object goes out of scope. Most common way is do it in the _ExitTree override method. </br>
> Another good option is to have a ResetScript that does that automaticly everytime before you enter the game scene.

### In-script counter vs Timer node

It's really common in game developement to have a counter varible which track the time before some actions happen. This can be done by using a in-script counter varible or the Timer node.

For more details, checkout [**Timer Docs**][timer_docs]

#### In-script counter

```cs
using Godot;

float counter = 0; // The counting time (in seconds)
float counterMax = 3; // The maxium time (in seconds)

public override void _Process(delta) {
  counter += delta;

  if (counter >= counterMax) {
    // Do some actions

    // Reset the counter
    counter = 0;
  }
}
```

This method is very common if you are comming from Unity. However, it requires a lot of boilerplate code.

#### Timer node (better option 90% of the time)

```cs
using Godot;

[Export] Timer timer; // drag and setup the timer node in the editor


override void _Ready() {
  timer.Timeout += TimerTimeout;
}

private void TimerTimeout() {
  // This will be call after setuped amount of second in the editor.
}

private override void _ExitTree() {
  // It's also good to unsubcribe before the node goes out of scope
  timer.Timeout -= TimerTimeout;
}

```

This should be the better way. However it's only recommended to use Timer node if your wait time is **more than 0.05 seconds**. If your wait time is longer than that, please prefer the in-script method.
